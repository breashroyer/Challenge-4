# Challenge-4


Project Description:
This project is about creating a web application called "Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz" to help coding boot camp students prepare for coding assessments and interviews. The app will be a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals with multiple-choice questions. Users will click a start button to begin the quiz, and a timer will start counting down while presenting questions. If a user answers a question incorrectly, time is deducted from the clock. The game ends either when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches zero. After the game ends, users can save their initials and score. This project aims to provide a practice tool for students to gauge their progress and improve their coding skills, particularly in JavaScript.
